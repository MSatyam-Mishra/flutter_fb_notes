## About This App

This app is  a simple extension to a [tutorial from Doctor Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL8Ujzh5DQc)
I created this project for learning purpose only. 

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
